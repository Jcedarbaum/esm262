## Overview

ESM 262 is an introduction to computing for environmental applications. Topics include: the basic computing environment (hardware and operating systems); programming language concepts; program design; data management, data structures and their implementation; software tools; workflows, version control, and reproducibility; generic analytical techniques (relational algebra, graphical analysis, visualization, etc.); and specific characteristics of environmental information. The course features **R** for programming, **Git** for version control, **Markdown** for documentation, and **GitHub** for collaboration and publishing.

Topics will be presented in weekly 3-hour modules mixing lectures and hands-on examples, using students' own computers. Previous programming experience is recommended but not required..
